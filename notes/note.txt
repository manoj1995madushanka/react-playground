state:
    It is component internal data that determines behaviour

component can be sateful or stateless

Lifting state up is coding your app so that the state from the child component is moved to the parent component
and the child component simply receives it via props.

Prop drilling is a commonly used term to describe having to pass Stage 3 props in several layers of components,
from the parent to the child, to the grandchild, and so on.
Note that if the source data changes, you will have to transfer those changes across the entire prop drilled
structure.

React context api solves the props drilling issue

Props drilling simply means passing a prop through props objects through several layers of components.
The more layers there are, the more repetitive and unnecessary this feels.
There are various ways to deal with this, as youâ€™ll learn in the lesson items that follow

Context Provider:
    component that stores the state

Context Consumer
    Component that will use the state
